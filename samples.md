# Stephen Lynch - Writing Samples

Below are a few examples of my past writing, editing, and ghostwriting work. During my career I have helped edit/publish hundreds of blog posts, external presentations, and speeches, so this is a small sample from an otherwise very large body of work. 

For each example, I provide notes about my role: how much collaboration there was with other writers/editors and the parts of the writing that I spearheaded.

## Stripe blog and newsroom examples:

### Stripe blog post on crypto payouts. [Product announcement]

- [https://stripe.com/blog/expanding-global-payouts-with-crypto](https://stripe.com/blog/expanding-global-payouts-with-crypto)
- Role: Assisted with the first draft of the blog post. Mostly took over the writing process when our CEO subsequently asked for a complete rewrite in 24 hours.

### Stripe Newsroom post on the above announcement. [Press release analogue]

- [https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/crypto-payouts](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/crypto-payouts)
- Role: Wrote and edited the post with input from colleagues on the Comms team.

### Extensive rewrite of a highly technical draft about a massive software migration project. [Stripe Engineering blog]

- [https://stripe.com/blog/migrating-to-typescript](https://stripe.com/blog/migrating-to-typescript)
- Role: Sourced the idea from a short segment during an all-hands meeting. I took a mostly unreadable first draft from one of the engineers and hammered it into a detailed (but much more readable) final product for a software engineering audience. We also ended up [getting Insider to write a story](https://www.businessinsider.com/stripe-migrated-its-largest-javascript-codebase-to-typescript-2022-7) about this software migration project, which was a nice bonus.

## Executive speeches:

### Stanford MCS/Math/Stats joint commencement speech for the former LinkedIn data science lead (now: Chief Data Officer) Ya Xu. [Commencement speech (text)]

- [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/grow-past-your-weaknesses-commencement-speech-stanford-ya-xu/?trackingId=9O7LQf5DT%2FGidiCbNUzVcQ%3D%3D](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/grow-past-your-weaknesses-commencement-speech-stanford-ya-xu/?trackingId=9O7LQf5DT%2FGidiCbNUzVcQ%3D%3D)
- Role: Co-wrote the speech with an agency partner, based on a few conversations with Ya and feedback on the final draft from LinkedIn's then-CMO.

### Stripe CTO David Singleton speech at SaaStr. [Keynote speech (video)]

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2BPdAk_riU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2BPdAk_riU)
- Role: Developed this speech in two weeks with input from David. Worked with a graphic designer on some of the initial content, but also was forced to step in when the organizers asked us to change some slides to be less obliquely promotional. David didn't have time on his schedule to memorize the speech, so he's actually from the presenter notes the entire time.

## Corporate blog post writing, ghostwriting, and editing:

### Blog post by LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky on an upcoming "responsible AI" project (which was itself one of the initiatives I had launched and was leading). [LinkedIn Official Blog]

- [https://blog.linkedin.com/2020/may/26/helping-every-company-build-more-inclusive-products](https://blog.linkedin.com/2020/may/26/helping-every-company-build-more-inclusive-products)
- Role: This blog post repurposed a piece that I had originally written for the Chief Data Officer. The CMO advocated for Ryan taking a more active role in this work, so it was upleveled. It was reviewed by the CMO, head of comms, Legal team, Policy team, etc. There were several rounds of edits, given the number of stakeholders.

### Technical blog post announcing the release of the "responsible AI" project that I mentioned in the prior bullet point. [LinkedIn Engineering Blog]

- [https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/bringing-project-every-member-to-life](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/bringing-project-every-member-to-life)
- Role: Wrote the blog post based on a research paper (which I also helped edit, preprint on arXiV [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05819)). The Legal team had to review the post. We had to compromise a bit on how much detail we could include in describing the Atkinson Inequality issues vs. keeping it accessible to reporters. I also created the graphics for this post.

### OpenDNS research blog post written to announce new research & drive media interest. [OpenDNS blog--note that the post-acquisition move to Cisco's CMS has broken some paragraph formatting].

- [https://web.archive.org/web/20210621072534/https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/opendns-cracks-predictive-security](https://web.archive.org/web/20210621072534/https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/opendns-cracks-predictive-security)
- Role: Wrote content based on conversations with the research team. Some light editing and at least two rounds of general feedback from the head of comms (I was powerless to stop her from putting spaces on either side of em dashes, ha!).

### Ghostwritten blog post for the CMO of Palo Alto Networks. [Palo Alto Networks blog]

- [https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2012/01/i-am-a-social-media-fanatic](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2012/01/i-am-a-social-media-fanatic)
- Role: Wrote this blog post based on reading the summary for a report and speaking with their head of comms. Final product was edited by the head of comms, and the CMO added a slightly risqu√© intro which was definitely not my idea.
